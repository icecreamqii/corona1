This sample shows how to check if an Android app is licensed from the Google Play store.

Note that this sample app must be built and uploaded to the Google Play store, but you don't need to publish it. You must also specify your license key within the "config.lua" file. Once uploaded, it may take a few hours for the app to be registered by Google.
