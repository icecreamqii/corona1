This sample project exhibits the "physicsContact" along with pre-collision handling to demonstrate one-sided platforms which a character can jump through from underneath but land on from atop.

Touch the screen to make the character (ball) jump, observing how the collision is disregarded when the contact point is not atop a platform.
