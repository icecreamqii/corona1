This sample project exhibits a basic "point" type emitter object where particles are emitted from a single point in space.

Use the slider controls to dynamically change the emission angle, speed, and gravity applied to the particles. Tap the color channel buttons to adjust the red, green, blue, and alpha values for the emitted particles.
